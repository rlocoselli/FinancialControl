# FinancialControl
Project which uses .NET MVC to build up an useful Financial Control. This application allows to:

* Register your Expenses and Revenues;
* Segregate entries among different accounts;
* Control monthly and yearly base entries; 

# Technologies
We established SQL Server Express Edition as the database for this project although you may choose another based on your preferences. SQL Server allows us more flexibility to work with Entity Framework though. Scripts for SQL Server are locatedin SQLScripts and you need to create database firstly, it is not a code first project.
In terms of pattern, we use MVC provided by Microsoft Framework and resource files to add translations in 3 different languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese)
